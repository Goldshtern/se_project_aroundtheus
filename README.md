The webpage is responsive, the width of the content area is change depending on the width of the browser window, and there is haven't any horizontal scrolling.  
The minimum screen width supported is 320px, which have one card per row. The maximum window width is 1280px, meaning three cards per row — 880px for the content and 200px of empty space on each side. Even if the users browser window is wider, the content area will not get any wider. For tablet screen widths, the design will be the same as for desktop but with two cards in a row.
